This library is licensed under LGPL 3.0 and was created for game hacking/modding via memory modifications.

This project is a utility for my CSGO cheat Abendigo.

### Dependencies

We use some really cool technology to drive Abendigo. Here's a list:

- [Java Native Access (JNA)](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) as the backbone for interfacing with native libraries

### Plans

As of right now the project is currently not complete. The following are features I plan on adding:
 - Linux compatibility
 - OSX compatibility
